    "## Cookbook\n",
    "You want to use a cookbook to calculate amounts for any desired number of servings. For this your have following information:\n",
    "* filename of the recipe (`string`), e.g. `\"bananabread.recipe\"`\n",
    "* name of the desired recipe (`string`), e.g. `\"Bananabread\"`\n",
    "* `servings` -> number of servings (`int`), e.g. 3 <br>  \n",
    "\n",
    "The `.recipe`-file contains the desired recipe. From there, read the instructions and ingredients, calculate the needed amounts given by the servings and save them in a new file.  \n",
    "Such a `.recipe` file could look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Mix everything together and bake for 45min at 180°C.\n",
    "Wheat,180,g\n",
    "Sugar,100,g\n",
    "Cocoa,60,g\n",
    "Salt,1,pinch\n",
    "Baking Powder,1,tsp\n",
    "Chopped Chocolate,170,g\n",
    "Bananas,3,psc\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first line denotes always the instructoins and all following lines contains the ingredients. All ingreadients have the following structure:  \n",
    "`<Name of Ingredient>,<amount>,<unit>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now read all Ingredients and multiply the amount by the number of servings. Sace the final new recipe in a new `.txt` file with the same filename as the `.recipe` file (but with `.txt` as suffix).  \n",
    "The file should look like the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "How to make 3 serving(s) of Bananabread:\n",
    "Wheat: 540g\n",
    "Sugar: 300g\n",
    "Cocoa: 180g\n",
    "Salt: 3pinch\n",
    "Baking Powder: 3tsp\n",
    "Chopped Chocolate: 510g\n",
    "Bananas: 9pcs\n",
    "Oil: 180ml\n",
    "Mix everything together and bake for 45min at 180°C.\n",
